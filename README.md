# terraform-aws-hardening

This repository contains a Terraform module providing a secure baseline for a newly created [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com) account. AWS accounts default settings are more oriented towards easiness of use rather than applying the recommended secure best practices. `terraform-aws-hardening` is implemented as a set of Terraform configurations applying the best practices to all AWS regions.

**Make sure to use it only on accounts not containing any user-created resource (servers, databases, VPCs, etc.) as it has been tested only on newly created accounts**

The tool is heavily inspired by the [AWS Benchmarks - CIS Amazon Web Services Foundations v1.2.0](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/AWS_CIS_Foundations_Benchmark.pdf) and by the automated tool [CloudSploit](https://cloudsploit.com/). However, this tool does not guarantee a full compliance for an existing account: it operates only on newly created accounts by providing saner defaults. Again: do not use it on accounts that are not brand new (i.e., not containing user-created objects or data).

As today, applying this tool gets you a 100% green score on CloudSploit for a newly created AWS account.
